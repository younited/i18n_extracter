I18nExtracter
=============

This plugin will extract as many as possible I18n keys form your Rails project.
Several methods are employed:

Extracting keys
===============

First all possible keys are collected

* Parsing model, helper and controller files with a Ruby parser
* Parsing view files (ERB and HAML)
* Investigating ActiveRecord models and build required keys from that.

Then the code detects conflicting keys

  'txt.form.tooltip' => "This is a tooltip"
  'txt.form.tooltip.two' => "This is the second tooltip"

If needed new keys will be translated using Google translate. These translations
will be marked as # FUZZZY. If you remove the # FUZZZY marker you accept the translation
and the marker won't be placed again.

Finally all the available variables for a translation key are added as a comment. 
These are updated each time you run the script, without changing your translation.

  I18n.translate('welcome_message', :name => @user.name, :destination => @destination) 
  => welcome_message: "Welcome message" # FUZZZY # VARIABLES(name, destination)

Saving translation file
=======================

When the *file* option is given the YAML output will be placed in that file. If 
the file exists it will be updated:

* No keys will be deleted
* No translated values will be marked as # FUZZZY after it was removed
* # VARIABLES will be updated
* order of values will be preserved

Installation
============

  script/plugin install git://github.com/Bertg/i18n_extractor/tree/master

TODO
====
* [parsing]       when translation has :scope as a variable, update the key
* [parsing]       use the recording method as much as possible, it results in more correct results (haml, ruby files)
* [parsing]       parse ERB files
* [general]       write tests
* [general]       rewrite as a generator?
* [active_record] relationships between models could be seen as attributes
* [active_record] indicate methods model attributes
* [generating]    preserve other YAML comments
* [generating]    create .rb language files generator
* [translation]   create other translation engines?
